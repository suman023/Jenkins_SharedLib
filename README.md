# Jenkins_SharedLib
A Jenkins Shared Library is a reusable collection of Groovy scripts stored in a version control system (typically Git) that can be used by multiple Jenkins Pipeline jobs. This promotes the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle by allowing teams to centralize common, complex logic and standard build processes, making pipelines more efficient, consistent, and easier to maintain.
**Note: @Library() _ is the syntax to use shared library.**
